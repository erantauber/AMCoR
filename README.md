This is the github repository for the paper 'No codon is an island: Epigenetic selection for CpG codon islands.', available at: [Fill in]

There are multiple sets of code present, containing a combination of R scripts and python scripts (written using jupyter lab). 

The key files are:
- Master code - Containing the code that generates the CpG codon dyad data, as well as a version that allows input of genes
- Assorted graph generating R scripts
- small results files needed for analysis

To get details on any particular code, comments can be found within the scripts, and inquiries can be posted to the issues tab of this github.
